    title: "The Start of Paris Peace Conference",
    paragraph1:"The Paris Peace Conference, which commenced on 18 January 1919, was a pivotal moment in world history, marking the formal end of the First World War and shaping the political landscape of the 20th century. Convened in the aftermath of unprecedented global conflict and devastation, the conference brought together representatives from more than 30 nations with the primary goal of negotiating terms for peace and ensuring that such a catastrophic war would never occur again. The key players at the conference were the Allied Powers, especially the so-called “Big Four”: Woodrow Wilson of the United States, David Lloyd George of Great Britain, Georges Clemenceau of France, and Vittorio Orlando of Italy. Although many nations attended, these leaders wielded the greatest influence in determining the course of the negotiations.",
    paragraph2:"The conference aimed to address complex issues arising from the collapse of empires, such as those of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire. Delegates focused on territorial disputes, reparations, disarmament, and the establishment of new national boundaries based on the principle of self-determination. Among the most significant achievements of the Paris Peace Conference was the formation of the League of Nations, Woodrow Wilson’s visionary proposal for an international organization designed to maintain global peace and foster diplomatic cooperation among nations. Although the League faced limitations, particularly with the United States’ refusal to join, its creation marked a landmark step toward collaborative global governance.",
    paragraph3:"One of the most debated outcomes of the conference was the Treaty of Versailles, which imposed harsh penalties and reparations on Germany. While intended to ensure lasting peace, these terms later contributed to economic hardship and political instability, ultimately paving the way for the rise of extremism and the outbreak of the Second World War. Thus, the Paris Peace Conference stands as both a moment of hope and a lesson in the complexities of peace-making in a world recovering from war.",

    title: "The Treaty of Versailles",
    paragraph1:"The Treaty of Versailles, signed on 28 June 1919, stands as one of the most significant and controversial peace agreements in modern history. It marked the formal conclusion of the First World War between Germany and the Allied Powers and represented the culmination of months of negotiation at the Paris Peace Conference. Signed exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand—an event that triggered the war—the treaty sought to ensure peace and prevent another devastating global conflict. However, its terms would later spark intense debate and contribute to rising tensions in Europe.",
    paragraph2:"The treaty imposed severe political, military, and economic restrictions on Germany. One of its central provisions was the infamous “war guilt clause,” which placed full responsibility for the war on Germany and its allies. As a result, Germany was required to pay heavy reparations, a burden that strained its economy and contributed to widespread hardship among its people. The treaty also redrew the map of Europe by limiting German territory and sovereignty. Significant lands such as Alsace-Lorraine were returned to France, while new nations such as Poland were strengthened at Germany’s expense. Further, the German military was drastically reduced in size, and the nation was forbidden from building an air force, maintaining a navy beyond limited size, or stationing troops in certain regions like the Rhineland.",
    paragraph3:"In addition to punishing Germany, the Treaty of Versailles led to broader geopolitical changes. It established the League of Nations, an international body aimed at preventing future conflicts through diplomacy and collective security. While this represented a step toward global cooperation, the United States’ refusal to join weakened its effectiveness. Over time, resentment toward the treaty's harsh terms fueled political extremism in Germany and played a significant role in the rise of Adolf Hitler and the outbreak of the Second World War. Thus, although intended to secure lasting peace, the Treaty of Versailles remains a powerful reminder of the challenges and consequences of peace-making after war.",

    title: "Establishment of League of Nations",
    paragraph1:"The League of Nations was officially established on January 10, 1920, marking an important milestone in international diplomacy and efforts to maintain world peace. Born out of the devastation of the First World War, the League was envisioned as a global organization committed to preventing future conflicts through dialogue, cooperation, and collective security. Its creation reflected the desire of world leaders, particularly U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, to ensure that the catastrophic events of the Great War would never be repeated. Though the idea of collective international governance was ambitious and unprecedented, it represented a significant shift from old systems of secret alliances and power politics.",
    paragraph2:"Headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, the League aimed to resolve disputes peacefully and enforce international agreements. Its primary functions included promoting disarmament, preventing aggression, supervising mandated territories, and improving global welfare in areas such as labor rights, public health, and the protection of minority groups. The League’s structure was composed of an Assembly, a Council, and a Secretariat, supported by various commissions and committees focused on humanitarian and economic issues. While many countries initially joined, one of the most notable absences was the United States, which, despite Wilson’s advocacy, failed to ratify the organization’s covenant due to opposition in the U.S. Congress. This weakened the League’s authority and global influence from the beginning.",
    paragraph3:"Despite its noble goals and several early successes—such as mediating minor border disputes and addressing humanitarian crises—the League of Nations ultimately struggled to enforce its decisions. Its inability to prevent aggression by powerful nations, including Japan, Italy, and Germany in the 1930s, exposed its limitations and eroded its credibility. Nonetheless, the League’s establishment laid the foundation for modern international cooperation. Its principles and structures heavily influenced the creation of the United Nations in 1945, which sought to build on the League’s ideals with stronger mechanisms for maintaining global peace and stability.",

    title: "Mukden Incident",
    paragraph1:"The Mukden Incident, which occurred on September 18, 1931, stands as a pivotal event in early 20th-century international relations and a clear example of aggressive expansionism preceding the Second World War. The incident took place near Mukden (modern-day Shenyang) in northeastern China’s Manchuria region, a territory rich in natural resources and strategically valuable to Japan. At the time, Japan already exercised significant influence in Manchuria, particularly through control of the South Manchuria Railway. However, growing political and economic pressures within Japan led its militarists to seek full domination of the region.",
    paragraph2:"The incident itself involved the explosion of a small bomb near the railway tracks controlled by Japan. Although the damage was minimal and trains continued to operate, the Japanese military quickly blamed Chinese forces for sabotage. In reality, the explosion was orchestrated by elements of the Japanese Kwantung Army as a pretext for military invasion. Using this staged attack as justification, Japanese troops launched a full-scale occupation of Manchuria, encountering limited Chinese resistance. Within months, Japan established the puppet state of Manchukuo with the last Qing emperor, Puyi, installed as its nominal ruler, while real power remained firmly in Japanese hands.",
    paragraph3:"International reaction to the Mukden Incident was largely critical, particularly through the League of Nations, which sent the Lytton Commission to investigate. The commission concluded that Japan’s actions were aggressive and unjustified, recommending that Manchuria remain part of China. However, the League lacked effective enforcement power, and Japan simply withdrew from the organization in 1933. This failure to respond decisively exposed the League’s weakness and emboldened other aggressive powers in the years that followed. The Mukden Incident thus became a symbol of unchecked militarism and marked the beginning of Japan’s expansion across East Asia, contributing significantly to the tensions that eventually erupted into the Second World War.",

    title: "Japane Withdraw from League of Nations",
    paragraph1:"Japan’s withdrawal from the League of Nations in 1933 was a defining moment that highlighted the weakening authority of the League and the rising tide of militarism in the lead-up to the Second World War. The decision came after the League condemned Japan’s actions in Manchuria, following the Mukden Incident of 1931. The Lytton Commission, appointed by the League, concluded that Japan had acted aggressively and unjustifiably in occupying Manchuria and establishing the puppet state of Manchukuo. Rather than comply with international pressure or reverse its expansion, Japan chose to defend its actions and assert national pride and strategic interests.",
    paragraph2:"On March 27, 1933, Japan formally announced its exit from the League, signaling its rejection of collective diplomacy and its commitment to independent imperial ambitions. This withdrawal exposed the League’s inability to enforce decisions against powerful nations, encouraged further aggression by other authoritarian states, and marked Japan’s increasing isolation from Western powers, setting the stage for its future wartime expansion in Asia.",

    title: "Italy’s Attack on Ethiopia",
    paragraph1:"Italy’s attack on Ethiopia on October 3, 1935, marked a significant turning point in the failure of collective security and the rise of aggressive expansionist policies in the 1930s. Led by dictator Benito Mussolini, Fascist Italy sought to expand its empire and restore what Mussolini portrayed as Roman imperial glory. Ethiopia, one of the few independent African nations, became the target. Although Italy had previously been defeated by Ethiopia in 1896, Mussolini was determined to assert Italian dominance and redeem national pride.",
    paragraph2:"Italian forces launched a full-scale invasion from Eritrea and Italian Somaliland, employing modern weapons, aircraft, and even chemical warfare against largely ill-equipped Ethiopian troops. Despite appeals from Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie to the League of Nations, the organization failed to take decisive action. Economic sanctions imposed on Italy were limited and ineffective, as key resources like oil were excluded, and major powers hesitated to confront Mussolini.",
    paragraph3:"The invasion resulted in the occupation of Ethiopia in 1936 and exposed the League’s inability to prevent aggression by powerful states. Italy’s actions undermined international confidence in collective security and encouraged other expansionist nations, further destabilizing the global order and contributing to the path toward the Second World War.",

    title: "Benito Mussolini Announced Attack on Ethiopia",
    paragraph1:"Benito Mussolini formally announced Italy’s attack on Ethiopia on October 3, 1935, the same day Italian troops crossed the border to begin their invasion. Although the military operation had already begun without prior warning to the international community, Mussolini used a public address in Rome to declare Italy's intentions and rally national support. He portrayed the invasion as a mission of national destiny and a step toward renewing the glory of the Roman Empire, claiming that Italy was bringing “civilization” and justice to Africa. In reality, the attack was driven by imperial ambition and Mussolini’s desire to expand Fascist influence.",
    paragraph2:"Mussolini’s announcement marked a blatant challenge to international agreements and demonstrated his disregard for the League of Nations, of which Italy was still a member at the time. His declaration strengthened nationalist fervor in Italy, while signaling a major failure of collective security. It set a dangerous precedent for aggressive expansion and foreshadowed the coming conflicts that would lead to the Second World War.",

    title: "Italy Dropped Poison Gas Over Ethiopia",
    paragraph1:"During the invasion of Ethiopia, Italy resorted to one of the most brutal and internationally condemned tactics of modern warfare—the use of poison gas. Beginning in late 1935 and continuing into 1936, Italian forces under Benito Mussolini authorized the widespread deployment of mustard gas and other chemical agents against Ethiopian soldiers and civilians. This action violated the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which prohibited chemical warfare and to which Italy was a signatory. Yet Mussolini, determined to ensure rapid victory and demonstrate Fascist strength, ignored international agreements and moral restraint.",
    paragraph2:"Italian aircraft sprayed poison gas from the air and dropped gas-filled bombs over battlefields, villages, and even Red Cross medical stations. Mustard gas caused severe burns, blindness, respiratory failure, and long-term suffering. The Ethiopian army, poorly equipped and lacking gas masks, was devastated by these attacks. Civilians—including women, children, and livestock—were also targeted, contributing to immense human suffering and panic.",
    paragraph3:"Despite appeals from Emperor Haile Selassie to the League of Nations, international response remained weak and ineffective. The League condemned Italy’s actions but failed to impose meaningful sanctions. Italy’s use of chemical weapons became a powerful symbol of the failure of collective security and the global community’s inability to stop rising militarism in the 1930s, foreshadowing the atrocities to come in World War II.",

    title: "Italian Forces Attacked Red Cross Field Hospital",
    paragraph1:"On 30 December 1935, a field hospital operated by the Swedish Red Cross near Melka Dida (close to Dolo) was subjected to a heavy air-raid by the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Air Force). According to reports, around a dozen Italian aircraft attacked the hospital facility after dropping leaflets written in Amharic that explicitly warned of reprisals. Over a period of roughly 20 minutes, about 3,134 kg of explosives — including approximately 252 kg of mustard gas — were dropped on the site, resulting in at least 42 deaths and around 50 wounded. ",
    paragraph2:"This incident signified more than a tragic battlefield accident. The hospital displayed clear Red Cross emblems; documentation from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) highlights that virtually all identified field hospitals on the Ethiopian side were attacked or attempted to be attacked. The use of chemical weapons, targeted bombing of medical facilities, and explicit threats via leaflets all point to deliberate disregard for protections accorded under the Geneva Conventions. The attack undermined the very concept of humanitarian neutrality in conflict. The fact that such attacks persisted, despite protests from Emperor Haile Selassie and the ICRC, illustrates the failure of international mechanisms to enforce the laws of war in that era. ",

    paragraph1:"Emperor Haile Selassie I, the sovereign ruler of Ethiopia, made the difficult decision to leave his country in May 1936, during the Italian invasion led by Benito Mussolini. His departure was not an act of surrender but a strategic move to continue Ethiopia’s struggle for sovereignty on the international stage. As Italian forces advanced and the capital Addis Ababa faced imminent occupation, Haile Selassie chose exile to preserve the legitimacy of Ethiopia’s government and seek global support.",
    paragraph2:"Traveling to Europe, he addressed the League of Nations in Geneva in June 1936, delivering a historic speech that condemned Italian aggression and warned the world about the dangers of unchecked militarism. His plea highlighted Ethiopia’s suffering and the failure of collective security, becoming a defining moment in international diplomacy. Though forced to leave temporarily, Haile Selassie remained a symbol of resistance and later returned in 1941, after World War II, to reclaim his throne and restore Ethiopia’s independence.",
